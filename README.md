This folder contains a bunch of miscellaneous stuff that I did for fun brief description of which are given below:

autocomplete:  C program that given a dictionary, builds a trie and given a prefix string prints out all string that have the gtiven prefix.

listprimitive: a small, handy C library to link structures together with minimal changes need to existing code.
