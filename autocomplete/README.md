Word auto completion program using tries(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).  Just put some things together to exercise Tries.

Usage: ./autocomplete <path to filename>

Functions in trie.c should be extendable to include Capital words etc.  There are some corner cases and negative test cases to handle,
which I hope to do later down the line.
Ofcourse the driver functions are pretty ghetto-esque :( wrt cleaning up corner cases etc.
